These files should be copied to:

https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/building-resilient-iaas-architecture/lab-resources/


Note: They can't be copied to the 'Hands-on Lab' folder since that creates a path with a space, which is not compatible with the CustomScriptExtension used by the LabVM. Hence the use of the 'lab-resources' folder.
